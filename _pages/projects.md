    <strong>Wavelet-SNN Medical Image Classifier</strong>
  </summary>
  <p>
    This project leverages wavelet-transformed grayscale medical images and uses a spiking neural network (SNN) built with PyTorch and snntorch to perform classification. It's part of a broader research focus intersecting biomedical image analysis and neuromorphic computing.
