## Who Am I?
I am Amirhesam Jafari Rad, 22 years old, living in Tehran, Iran. I am currently in my last year of four-year bachelor's degree specializing in Digital Systems and Hardware Design at the University of Tehran.

## My Research Interests
In general, I like hardware design and FPGA implementation, but I am open to learning new things as I am deeply interested in any hardware-related fields, regardless of whether they are purely hardware. I always enjoy thinking about interdisciplinary fields, contributing to the intersection of hardware and (AI|Mathematics|Biomedical Engineering). Looking for new ideas associated with mix of my field and others where I can combine my interests with other areas of study is one of my favorite things!

## Other Interests and Activities
Apart from my academic pursuits, I have a passion for playing the guitar and santoor, an Iranian traditional instrument. I enjoy unwinding by creating new pieces on them. Moreover, playing volleyball, taekwondo, and swimming are my favorite physical activities.
