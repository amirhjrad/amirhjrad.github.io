## Who Am I?
I am Amirhesam Jafari Rad, 22 years old, living in Tehran, Iran. I am currently in my first year of master's degree specializing in Digital IC/Systems at the Univeristy of Tehran.

## My Research Interests?
In general, I like digital IC design and FPGA implementation along with AI, but I am open to learning new things regardless of whether they are purely hardware. I always enjoy exploring the interdisciplinary fields, contributing to the intersection of hardware and (AI|Mathematics|Biomedical Engineering). Looking for new ideas associated with combination of my field and others is one of my favorite things!


## Other Interests and Activities
Apart from my academic pursuits, I have a passion for playing the guitar and santoor, an Iranian traditional instrument. I enjoy unwinding by creating new pieces on them. Moreover, playing volleyball, taekwondo, and swimming are my favorite physical activities.
